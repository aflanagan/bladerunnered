One stop shop for getting your blade runner productivity-life-hack on.

Inspired by this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/3bt87u/san_francisco_bladerunner/)

I know this is totally random, but I thought I'd share.

The idea here is building on top of this idea by pulling it all in to one
place w/ fun customizations/tricks.

# Development

You can copy and paste this bit below to quickly get the project pulled and
initializted w/ all dependencies.

```
git clone git@github.com:derekr/bladerunnered.git
cd bladerunnered
npm install
```

Then you can run the dev server.

```
# runs a browserify dev server using wzrd on http://localhost:9966
# servers index.html
npm run dev
```
